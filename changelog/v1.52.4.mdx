## New Features

- The "Get Paid Faster" Onboarding: We've completely overhauled our onboarding and KYB (Know Your Business) dashboard. The new flow is streamlined, faster, and gets you from signup to "accepting payments" with way less friction.
- Subscription Free Trials & Discounts: You can now offer Free Trial and Discount Periods for your subscription plans. This is a powerful new tool to drive customer adoption and grow your recurring revenue.
- Bank Transfer now LIVE in Ghana on Checkout: We've officially added Bank Transfer as a new payment method for GHS transactions on checkout. This is a huge win for converting more customers in Ghana by offering the local payment methods they trust.


## Improvements & Updates 

- Filter Balance Ledger by Currency: Managing multiple currencies? Your life just got easier. The dashboard balance ledger can now be filtered by currency, making reconciliation a breeze.
- General Enhancements: A host of minor API enhancements, stability improvements, and bug fixes across the platform.
