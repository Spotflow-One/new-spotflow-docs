## New Features

- Public Key Security Model: This is a big one. We've rolled out a major security enhancement by separating key functions. Public Keys are now used for all server-to-server communications, while your Secret Key remains for client-side communications. This separation of duties is a massive leap forward for platform security.

## Improvements & Updates 

- Checkout Expiry Control: You can now set an expiry time for checkout URLs. If a customer doesn't complete the purchase in time, a session_expired ID is logged, giving you much better control over abandoned carts and time-sensitive offers.

- Webhook Fix on Accounts/Wallets: You can now be 100% certain that you get a webhook from Spotflow when a credit and debit is done on your wallets and accounts created for your customers.

- Payment Link UI tidy-up: We tidied up the Payment Link creation and management interface for both desktop and mobile. It's just cleaner, faster, and nicer to use.

- The Usual Housekeeping: A healthy round of performance optimizations, security tweaks, and minor bug fixes to keep the entire platform running smoothly.
