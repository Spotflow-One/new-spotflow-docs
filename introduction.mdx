    * **Identity Verification**: Verifies the individual managing the merchant account by requiring personal identification documents.

       Merchants can securely submit personal and business documents, which are reviewed manually for compliance.

    2. **Multiple Businesses**
       Merchants can add and verify multiple businesses under a single account, allowing seamless switching between verified businesses.
