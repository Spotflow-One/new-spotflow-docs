title: Create Dynamic Account
description: Dynamic accounts don't act as independent money storage - they simply channel incoming payments straight to your account. These accounts cannot process outgoing payments or be linked to payment terminals. Since virtual accounts do not serve as containers for funds, there's no need for BVN verification during setup.
