description: Dynamic accounts are intelligent payment routing tools that automatically channel incoming collections directly to your main Spotflow account. Think of them not as bank accounts that hold money, but as virtual smart conduits that simplify payment collection without fund segregation.

| **Payment Routing**       | Automatically forward all incoming collections to your main merchant account.                                          | 
| **No Fund Storage**       | Dynamic accounts do not hold or store money independently—it's immediately routed.                                     | 
| **Simplified Setup**      | No lengthy verification (like BVN) is required during the creation process.                                            | 
| **API-Driven**            | All dynamic account operations are performed seamlessly through API endpoints.                                         | 
| **Expiry Time Limit**     | Accounts have a default maximum expiry of 30 minutes, but you can set your own time limit via the API during creation. | 


### Key Features
Dynamic accounts are collection-focused, meaning they come with strict restrictions:
- No Outgoing Payments: They cannot be used to process outbound transfers or payments (they're strictly a one-way street).
- No Terminal Support: They cannot be linked to payment terminals or POS devices.
- Routing Only: Their function is exclusively as payment collection points.
