title: MoR VS PG
description: "Digital businesses often face a choice: the hands-on approach of a Payment Gateway (PG) or the simplified path of a Merchant of Record (MoR). At Spotflow, we operate as your Merchant of Record (MoR) to simplify global payments, especially across Africa, by managing compliance, local taxes, and complex payment rails."

## What It Means For You

Choosing Spotflow as your MoR means we become the legal seller to your customers, allowing you to:

- Launch Fast in Africa: Instantly access local payment methods crucial for conversion (Mobile Money, Bank Transfers) without integrating multiple PSPs.
- Decentralize Risk: Spotflow assumes liability for compliance, local laws, and currency conversion.
- Focus on Product: Skip setting up local entities, avoid handling VAT/GST, and reduce your entire legal risk profile.
- Visual: Imagine selling a subscription in Ghana. With Spotflow, we collect the payment via Mobile Money, handle the local tax, and send you the net revenue. No local entity required. Just growth.

## Why It Matters for African Expansion
For scaling digital businesses, managing multiple local payment rails and tax mandates is the bottleneck.
