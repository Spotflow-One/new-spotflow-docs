title: Spotflow Wallets
description: Spotflow Wallets (formerly called sub-accounts) are powerful, virtual, API-only financial containers designed to store and manage funds independently within your account ecosystem. Unlike Dynamic Accounts, which simply route payments, Wallets maintain their own balances and act as genuine repositories for money.

| **Non-Expiring**                 | Wallets do not expire, unlike Dynamic Accounts. They're permanent storage pockets.    | 
| **Supported Currencies**         | Currently available only for NGN and GHS.                                             | 
| **Independent Management**       | Each Wallet operates with its own unique ID, balance, and transaction history.        | 
| **Simplified Setup**             | No Bank Verification Number (BVN) submission is required for creation.                 | 


### Prerequisites for Wallet Creation
