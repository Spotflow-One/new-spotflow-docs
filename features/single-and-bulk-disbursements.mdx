## Linking & Prerequisites for Initiating Disbursements

To execute disbursements successfully, follow these steps:
1. **Perform a Bank Account Lookup**: Before sending funds, it’s highly recommended to confirm the recipient's details. Use the [Resolve Bank Account Endpoint](/api-reference/transfer-api/transfer-resolve-account) which requires the recipient’s accountNumber and bankCode(the unique bank identifier) as input. This prevents accidentally sending money to the wrong bank entirely.
2. Ensure Linked Account: Disbursements are initiated from the primary operational account Spotflow creates for you internally. Ensure this is properly funded and linked to your operations.

## Executing Disbursements

You can move funds from your internal Spotflow account to an external bank account using one of two methods:

| **Disbursement Type**        | **API Endpoint**                                                                   | **Description**                                                                                                                                                              |
| ---                          | ---                                                                                | ---                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Single Disbursement**      | [Create Disbursement Endpoint](/api-reference/transfer-api/create-single-transfer) | Initiate a single payout. Requires key details like the disbursement amount, your chosen unique reference for reconciliation, and the recipient’s accountNumber and bankCode.|
| **Bulk Disbursement**        | [Bulk Disbursement Endpoint](/api-reference/transfer-api/create-bulk-transfer)     | Initiate multiple payouts with a single API call. Ideal for mass payments (e.g., payroll or vendor payments).                                                                |

**Remember**: A solid reconciliation reference is your best friend when dealing with finance. Use that reference wisely!
