## What Subscriptions Are (And Who Needs Them)
Subscriptions are recurring products purchased on a set schedule. They are perfect for:

- SaaS Licenses: Apps, APIs, or platform access.
- Memberships: Communities, programs, or clubs.
- Digital Content: Courses, media, or premium access.

## Key Benefits of Spotflow Subscriptions:
- Predictable Revenue: Automated renewals handle the heavy lifting.
- Flexible Cycles: Monthly, daily, weekly, annual, custom intervals, and trials are all supported.
- Plan Agility: Manage upgrades, and optional add-ons.
- Developer-First: Clear APIs for creation, changes, and usage tracking.

## Core Requirement: Card Tokenization
Spotflow's recurring billing relies on secure Card Tokenization.

***How it Works***: 
After a customer's initial successful card payment, Spotflow replaces the sensitive card information with a unique, secure token.
Subsequent payments are processed using this token. Therefore, recurring payments are currently limited to card payments only. 
You can choose automated payment plans, Set the cycle and amount; Spotflow handles the rest.

## Creating Subscription Plans
Create recurring pLANS either directly in your Spotflow Dashboard or programmatically via API.
To set up a [recurring billing plan](/api-reference/subscription-plans/create-single-plan), define these key elements:

| Field                                | Description                                                                                |
|----------------------------------    |--------------------------------------------                                                |
| **Title & Frequency**                | A descriptive label and how often to charge (Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Annually, etc.).      |
| **Currency**                         | You can set pricing in USD or in a Local Currency (e.g., NGN, GHS, ZAF).                   |
| **Pricing Options**                  | Allows you to set different local prices for the same product across different regions.    |

## Example: Creating a Local Currency Plan (NGN, GHS)

```java Create.plan lines icon="repeat"
{
  "title": "My Pro Plan",
  "frequency": "MONTHLY",
  "pricingOptions": [
    { 
       "amount": 10000, "currency": "NGN" 
    },
    {  "amount": 10, "currency": "GHS" 
    }
  ]
}
```
## API Management & Enrollment
Once a plan is created, enrolling a customer is simple: reference the planId during the customer's initial charge.

| **Action**                          | **API Endpoint**                                                                    | **Description**                                           |
| ---                                 | ---                                                                                 | ---                                                       |
| **Create Subscription Plan**        | [POST /subscription plans](/api-reference/subscription-plans/create-single-plan)    | Create a new subscription programmatically.               |
| **Update Subscription Plan**        | [PUT /subscription plans/{id}](/api-reference/subscription-plans/update-plan)       | Modify quantities, change plans, or set cancellation.     |         
| **List/Retrieve Subscription Plan** | [GET /subscriptions](/api-reference/subscription-plans/fetch-plan)                  | View all or retrieve details for a single subscription.   |
 
 You can also create a ***bulk subscription plan*** using a CSV file. Learn more [here](/api-reference/subscription-plans/create-bulk-plan).

## Enrollment Sample (Using [Spotflow Initialize/Redirect API](/api-reference/payments/initialize-collection)):
When initiating the charge, include the planId and customer details. Spotflow tokenizes the card for future charges based on the plan frequency.

```java Create.plan lines icon="repeat"
{
  "planId": "961ca3d6-0505-4bc5-8dd3-fc160ac4afc9",
  "currency": "USD",
  "localCurrency": "NGN", // Used for FX calculation in the local region
  "customer": 
  { "email": "customer@email.com" 
  }, // ... other charge details (encrypted card, metadata)
}
```

## Webhooks: Real-Time Event Tracking
Spotflow sends automated webhooks to your server for all critical subscription events.

To set up a [recurring billing plan](/api-reference/subscription-plans/create-single-plan), define these key elements:

| **Event**                     | **Purpose**                                               | **Sample Payload Key**                      |
| ---                           | ---                                                       | ---                                         |
| **payment_successful**        | Notifies you of the first successful payment charge       | {`"event": "payment_successful",...`}       |
| **subscription_successful**   | Notifies you of a successful renewal charge               | {`"event": "subscription_successful",...`}  |       
| **payment_failed**            | Alerts you when an attempted charge fails                 | {`"event": "payment_failed",...`}           |
| **subscription_cancelled**    | Notifies you when a customer or you cancel the service.   | {`"event": "subscription_cancelled",...`}   |       


## Canceling and Activating
- Cancel Subscription: Cancel an individual customer subscription via the [Cancel Subscription Endpoint](/api-reference/subscriptions/subscription-cancel).
- Cancel Plan: Canceling [the entire plan](/api-reference/subscription-plans/cancel-plan) cancels all associated customer subscriptions.
- Reactivating: Canceled [subscriptions](/api-reference/subscriptions/subscription-activate) and [plans](/api-reference/subscription-plans/activate-plan) can be reactivated using the corresponding Activate endpoints.

## Best Practices
- Start with clear tiers: Keep base plans simple and define 2–3 plans with obvious value differences.
- Communicate pricing: Always show the total price, proration costs (if applicable), and the date of the next renewal.
- Test changes: Validate all plan changes and proration logic meticulously in Test Mode before deploying live.
