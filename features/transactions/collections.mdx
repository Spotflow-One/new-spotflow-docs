## Collections Listing Overview
The Collections listing serves as a single record of every transaction, featuring vital information such as the amount, currency, status, and the payment method used.

| **Status**               | **Meaning**                                                                                                          | 
| ---                      | ---                                                                                                                  |
| **In Progress**          | The collection is currently being processed by the financial institution.                                            | 
| **Abandoned**            | The user initiated the checkout process but did not complete the collection (they left the cart at the payment step).| 
| **Failed**               | The collection attempt was unsuccessful.                                                                             | 
| **Successful**           | The collection was completed successfully, and funds are secured.                                                    | 


<Note>
The final payment method and timestamp are updated only once the collection reaches a final state (Successful, Failed, or Abandoned).

### How to Navigate and Use the Collections Page
1. Access Collections: Open the Transactions page and click on the Collections tab to view all transaction records.
2. Filter and Search: Use available filters to narrow down your view:
 - Status Filter: View transactions by a specific status (e.g., filter for "Abandoned" to analyze drop-off).
 - Date Range: Select custom dates to view collections from a specific period.
 - Search: Locate payments by reference, customer name, or email.

### Important Information on Payment Methods
1. Automatic Activation: All supported collection methods become available automatically once your Spotflow account is verified and Live Mode is enabled.
2. Zero Configuration: Merchants do not need to configure these payment options; they are pre-defined and fully managed by Spotflow (we handle the complexity, you handle the selling).
3. Expanding Roster: We are constantly adding new payment methods. If you require a specific payment method that's not listed, 
please write to us at support@spotflow.one, and we'll add to our roadmap if not present.
