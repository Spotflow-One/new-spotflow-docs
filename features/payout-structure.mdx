#### Instantaneous Payouts (Self-Service)
You don't always have to wait. You can initiate a payout yourself in the local currency collected using the Single or Bulk Disbursement page on your Dashboard.
- How it works: Disburse funds immediately from the available balance in your multi-currency wallets.

#### Scheduled Payout Cycles
Requesting Weekly: Merchants with higher transaction volume may contact support@spotflow.one to request a weekly payout cycle.
For USD payouts, funds typically reflect in your bank account in T+1 days after initiation.

#### Key Requirements & Timelines
- Payouts are only initiated if all verifications are successful and the Minimum Payout Threshold is met during the billing period.
- Certain high-risk merchants may be placed on a Monthly cycle at Spotflow's discretion.

#### Payout Deductions
Before the funds are transferred, the following are deducted from your sales amount:
- Fees: Spotflow Processing Fees and Payout Fees. (Contact [support](mailto:support@spotflow.one) for a detailed breakdown)
