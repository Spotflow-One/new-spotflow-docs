## Settlement Process Overview

1. Collection: Funds are successfully collected from your customers.
2. Reconciliation: Spotflow meticulously verifies all collected payments to ensure every penny is accounted for (no phantom funds allowed).
3. Initiation: Once reconciled, the settlement request is initiated (either automatically or by you, depending on your schedule).
4. Fund Transfer: Spotflow transfers the collected funds to your specified bank account.
5. Confirmation: You receive a confirmation with the exact amount transferred and the settlement date.

### Settlement Schedule
Spotflow offers flexible options, with funds generally hitting your account in T + 1 days (Transaction day plus one business day) after collection.
You can typically choose the settlement cycles you'll prefer. For better details, contact support@spotflow.one for better details.

<Note>
Your settlement cycle is dependent on your transaction volume. The higher your transaction volume, the easier it is for us to provide you flexible settlement options.
