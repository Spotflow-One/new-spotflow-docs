At Spotflow, a thorough verification process is non-negotiable. We are a Merchant of Record, and we take compliance seriously with regulatory standards and platform policies. 
This process covers Business Verification and strict Anti-Money Laundering (AML) checks.

### KYB Verification (Know Your Business)
This is required for all registered entities to confirm company legitimacy and the authority of its representatives.

Required Details:

- **Company Registration Number**: Provide the number and a supporting document (e.g., Certificate of Incorporation).
- **Tax ID**: Provide a valid Tax ID and its documents. (Examples: EIN, CRN, VAT ID, GSTIN)
- **Director/Owner Information**: Details about all individuals appointed as Directors/Business Owners, as per local laws.

### Additional Information
Our compliance team may occasionally request additional information from time to time. These requests won't block payments, but failure to submit them may result in temporary pauses in payouts or account restrictions.


### Timeline & Support

- Typical verification time: **1–3 business days (weekends and public holidays excluded)**
- Support: If you need assistance, reach out to [support@spotflow.one](mailto:support@spotflow.one).


### Resubmission of Documents

If there are issues with your initial submission, our Support/Compliance Team will notify you via email and request specific documents.

### When Resubmission is needed:

- **Missing or Incomplete essential details**: If essential details such as identification numbers, business name, or other key data are missing.
- **Document Mismatch with the information provided**: When the documents submitted do not match the business or personal information provided.
- **Unreadable or Expired documents**: If the uploaded documents are unclear, illegible, or have expired.
- **Additional Clarification Needed**: If the verification team requires further documentation to clarify your identity or business information.
