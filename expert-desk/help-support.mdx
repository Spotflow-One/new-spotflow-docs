## 1. **Self-Service Documentation (The First Stop)**

The Spotflow Documentation Portal is your primary resource for comprehensive platform and integration details. Before raising an issue, 99% of your answers are here.

This portal includes: Detailed feature explanations, step-by-step integration guides, API documentation, and Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs).
This feature empowers you as a merchant with structured, self-paced learning to master our platform on your own time.

📌 **Best for**: Technical documentation, In-depth learning and implementation guidance.


## 2. **Dedicated Technical Chat Support**

If you hit a wall, you need engineers, not bots. For complex or integration-specific issues, we move straight to a personalized technical group chat.

- The Channel: We prefer Slack, but WhatsApp groups are also available upon request if preferred.
- The Team: When you raise an issue that requires escalation, we assemble a dedicated channel for you that includes:

1. Integration Engineers to guide your setup with technical walkthrough calls/videos.
2. Support/Operations Specialists for account-level issues or questions.
3. Backend Engineers (for deep technical bug fixes).

📌 **Best for**: Account-related concerns, technical escalations, and complex troubleshooting that requires direct code-level input.

**Our Pledge**: We skip the long queue. If your issue is confirmed as technical, we get the right eyes on it immediately to unblock your development. 
Response and resolution time is instantaneously 1 hour to 24 business hours.
