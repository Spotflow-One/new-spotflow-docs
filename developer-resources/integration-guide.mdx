- Telegram

Your customer just clicks and pays.

## Step 6:  Test Your Payment Link

## Step 7:  Track Payments in Real Time

According to the different currencies you created the payment link, head back to the Collections page on your dashboard to see:
- Payment status
- Timestamps
- Payment channels/methods
- Customer details

You can also configure webhooks for payment notifications:
   - Go to Settings > Webhooks
   - Add a webhook URL for payment notifications
   - [Detailed Guide](/developer-resources/webhooks/overview)

This makes reconciliation quick and stress-free.

If someone can click a link, they can pay you.
